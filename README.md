Software Engineer Coding For Fun

## Description

A place with where we share knowledge, practice and grow together

In this practice, you need to write code and test to make sure the functions are working as expected in the app.service.ts file under src/service

## GOAL

100% test pass, 100% test coverage, TDD

## Step1. Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Step2. Implement code and test

Code should be implemented in
src/service/app.service.ts
src/service/app.service.spec.ts

Run test to verify things work

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test
```

Alternatively, this command below will automatically trigger test on save

```bash
$ npm run test:watch
```

## Hint

Look at existing test code.
